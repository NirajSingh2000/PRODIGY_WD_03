# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game

A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to play the game on the same device, with visual indicators for the players' moves (green for "X" and red for "O"). The game also includes a modal popup to display the result (win or tie) and an option to restart the game.

## Features
- Two-player mode (Player "X" and Player "O")
- Green color for "X" and Red color for "O" when placing a marker
- Modal popup to show the result (win or tie) at the end of the game
- Restart button to reset the game after a result is shown

## How to Play
1. Click on any of the empty cells on the 3x3 grid to place your mark ("X" or "O").
2. The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
3. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, a "Game Tie" message will be shown.
5. After a win or tie, click the "Restart Game" button to play again.
